## Task & Requirements
The task in this programming assignment is to implement a parallelized application leveraging the University of Melbourne HPC facility SPARTAN. The application will use a large Twitter dataset and a file containing the suburbs, locations and Greater Capital cities of Australia. Your objective is to:\
• **count the number of different tweets made in the Greater Capital cities of Australia,**\
• **identify the Twitter accounts (users) that have made the most tweets,**\
• **identify the users that have tweeted from the most different Greater Capital cities.**

The application should allow a given number of nodes and cores to be utilized. Specifically, it should be run once to search the bigTwitter.json file on each of the following resources:\
• **1 node and 1 core;**\
• **1 node and 8 cores;**\
• **2 nodes and 8 cores (with 4 cores per node).**
